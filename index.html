          <p>
            Overall, my career aspiration is to be either a researcher at a national laboratory or a
            company. My main research interest is in building software that can make scientific and
            cloud-based applications portable, performant, and programmable. Modern scientific and
            cloud-based applications require the efforts of multiple computers in order to run
            efficiently and to store all of their data. Furthermore, these applications are confined
            by data access speeds, requiring the intelligent use of storage and memory systems.
            However, building distributed applications while considering the underlying architecture
            of the system makes them difficult to program and maintain, especially when hardware is
            diverse and rapidly changing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Other interests of mine are algorithm design and data science, which are both skills
            that are useful to parallel/distributed processing research. I have been involved in
            numerous projects surrounding parallel processing, algorithm design, and data science.

                Modern scientific applications are bounded by data access speeds. HCompress is a C++
                library for caching data in a heterogeneous distributed environment. It employs a
                dynamic and adaptive compression system for matching compression libraries to
                different storage devices using reinforcement learning. We found that HCompress
                improved the performance of real-world workloads by as much as 700% relative to
                other modern storage solutions.

                The FCC estimated that 10,000 lives could be saved annually if commercial mobile
                radio service (CMRS) providers were able to find the indoor location of emergency
                callers in a multi-story building. The BOSSA Platform is a proof-of-concept system
                that can find the indoor location of a cell phone using signals from Bluetooth Low
                Energy (BLE) beacons and a backend server for calculating indoor location based off
                of signal strengths. In our trials, we were able to estimate the floor the caller
                was on 100% of the time as well as the position on the floor to within 10 meters of
                accuracy.

                Pothole damage costs US drivers $3 billion per year. In order to combat this
                problem, driverless pothole-filling robots will become reality. In this project, we
                developed a routing algorithm based off of a combination of the Chinese Postman
                Problem and the Traveling Salesman Problem. We used OpenStreetMap and Geopandas to
                obtain graphs of the wards of Chicago and used the Chicago Data Portal to get the
                set of active pothole reports in Chicago.
