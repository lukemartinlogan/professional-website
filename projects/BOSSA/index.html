              In 2014, the FCC estimated that 10,00 lives could be saved per year
              if the indoor location of emergency callers using cell phones were
              provided. That same year, the FCC mandated that commercial mobile
              radio service (CMRS) providers must provide the indoor location of
              an emergency caller by finding the floor the user is on as well as
              the position on that floor to within 50 meters of accuracy.
              The BOSSA Platform is a service that can compute the indoor
              location of an emergency caller in real-time using signal
              strengths from bluetooth beacons.

              In this project, my role was to deploy the bluetooth beacons in
              participating buildings, gather test data, tune the model to
              the test data, and then test the accuracy of the location
              estimates.

            <p class="project-p">
              A person in distress calls emergency services using a cell phone inside of a
              multi-story building that has been outfitted with an array of bluetooth beacons. The
              phone begins polling nearby bluetooth beacons for signal strengths for a certain
              period of time (in our tests 5 or 10 seconds). During this scan, the phone will amass
              a dataset that contains a list of beacons and their received signal strength
              indicators (RSSIs) at different moments in time. When the scan period has elapsed, the
              phone will send this dataset over to the BOSSA Platform, where the indoor location can
              be estimated.

            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 1: Convert RSSI to distance</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              Compute the average RSSI for each beacon and then take the three beacons with the
              highest average RSSIs and convert those RSSI values into distances. The distance is
              an estimate of how far away the caller is from a particular beacon. This works off
              of the principle that RSSI will decrease with distance, so the lower the RSSI value,
              the further away the caller is from the beacon. However, many factors influence RSSI
              outside of distance. Obstructions such as walls and interference due to
              electromagnetic sources like WiFi also play a role in this measurement. This is why
              we only take the hottest three beacons: we want to minimize noise.
            </p>

            <p class="project-p">We convert RSSI to distance as follows:</p>

            <p class="project-p-math">$$
              \begin{equation*}
                dist(rssi) =
                \begin{cases}
                    2\text{m} & -60 > rssi \geq -80 \:\text{dBm} \\
                    5\text{m} & -80 > rssi \geq -100 \:\text{dBm} \\
                    9.5\text{m} & -100 > rssi \geq -\infty \:\text{dBm} \\
                \end{cases}

            <p class="project-p">
              At this point, we have the distance each beacon is from the caller.
              In order for this information to be useful, we must also know the
              position of each beacon. The building, floor, and (x,y) coordinate on
              that floor is recorded in the BOSSA Platform for each beacon during
              deployment. Now we can estimate the caller's indoor location.

            <p class="project-p">
              First, we calculate the building the user is in. This is done by
              simply selecting the building that most frequently occurs among the
              three beacons.

            <p class="project-p">
              Next, we calculate the floor the user is on. This is
              done by taking a weighted average of the floors the beacons are on
              where the weight is the estimated distance of the beacon.

            <p class="project-p-math">$$
              floor = round\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{3}{\frac{floor_i}{dist(rssi_i)}}} {\sum_{i=1}^{3}{\frac{1}{dist(rssi_i)}}}\right)

            <p class="project-p">
              We had to deploy beacons in a multi-story building in order to get location estimates.
              We were granted permission to deploy beacons in the hallways of Stuart Building (SB)
              at the Illinois Institute of Technology Mies Campus. We were not allowed to place
              beacons in the classrooms and offices since the beacons gave off an ominous presence
              that made people feel like they were being spied on. We deployed 10 beacons to the
              first and second floor of Stuart and recorded the position of each beacon in the BOSSA
              Platform's backend server. We arranged the beacons in such a way that no matter
              where a caller was standing in the hallways, they would receive strong signals from
              at least three beacons.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="project-phase">
            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 2: Gather test data</h3>
            <p>
              Using maps of the first 2 floors of SB, we identified test positions to collect data
              from. We evenly divided the test positions among the hallways. There were 12 positions
              on SB01 and 8 positions on SB02. We created an application using AndroidStudio and the
              AltBeacon library to collect test data from the test positions. When polling the
              bluetooth beacons, we used scanning periods of 5 seconds and 10 seconds. We collected
              test data for three days total, spread over a period of three months. Overall, we
              ended up with 61 data points for the 5 second period and 49 for the 10 second.

          <li class="project-phase">
            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 3: Model fitting</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              Since the space of all possible solutions was so small, we used a simple
              guess-and-check approach in order to determine the binning strategy. From our test
              data, we noted that RSSIs were in the range [-105dBm, -60dBm]. We also assumed that
              the tester was no more than 30 meters away from any of the three hottest beacons. We
              randomly guessed 100 different binning strategies under these constraints and selected
              the one that resulted in the least amount of error. We verified the robustness
              of this model by running this simple optimization over test data for individual
              days and then verifying that the bins produced still gave good location estimates.
              We found that the bins remained nearly the same, and produced similar results.

          <li class="project-phase">
            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 4: Performance analysis</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              Using the bins produced by this algorithm, we were able to guess the floor the
              tester was on 100% of the time. Furthermore, we were able to estimate the
              position on that floor to within 4 meters of error 57% of the time,
              6 meters of error 71% of the time, and 10 meters 100% of the time. In an emergency
              situation, these estimates produce results that are good enough to help first
              responders locate a person in distress. However, expanding the test environment
              to a building with more than two floors will be essential.
