              Pothole damage costs US drivers $3 billion annually. In order to combat this problem,
              driverless pothole-filling robots will become reality. In order to prepare for this, our
              team designed a routing algorithm to decide which blocks in Chicago to visit in order to
              fill potholes effectively, a machine-learning algorithm to predict the number of
              potholes that would be formed in a ward of Chicago over a period of time (which can be
              used to determine the number of robots that would be necessary to counteract more
              potholes from forming), and a website to visualize the results of the routing algorithm
              and the pothole count predictor.
            </p>

            <p class="project-p">
              In this project, I was responsible for the design and implementation of the routing
              algorithm. The algorithm is implemented in Python and uses OSMNX to get graphs of
              Chicago, Geopandas to divide the graph of Chicago into wards using ward boundaries, and
              the Chicago Data Portal to get active pothole locations. The algorithm divides the graph
              of wards of Chicago into blocks, assigns potholes to blocks, and then ranks each block
              based off of the number of pothole reports in the block, the amount of time it would
              take to fill every pothole in the block, and the distance the block is from the facility
              a robot is located in. The route is decided using a combination of the Traveling
              Salesman Problem (TSP), Binary Programming, and the Chinese Postman Problem (CPP).

        <h2 class="project-h">Scenario</h2>
        <p class="project-p">
          We have a weighted, directed multigraph of a ward in Chicago. The edges of this
          graph are roads and the vertices are intersections. The ward has potholes as well as
          robots to fill those potholes. Each robot can travel a certain maximum speed and are
          assigned to designated facilities in the ward. Ie, each robot is assigned to a
          vertex in the graph of the ward. The robot can be outside for a certain period of
          time before traffic becomes an issue, but the robots cannot travel faster than the
          speed limit on any particular road. Furthermore, it takes time to fill each pothole
          in the ward (we assume it's a constant). We want the robots to fill the potholes in
          the ward for as long as it can be outside without disturbing traffic. Furthermore,
          we want the robot to return to the facility where it came from when it is done
          filling potholes.

            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 1: Make the ward graph strongly connected</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              By default, the graph of a ward is a directed multigraph, and it is not
              necessarily strongly connected. This means it's possible for the robot to never be
              able to return to the facility where it came from.
            </p>

            <p class="project-p">
              In order to make the graph of the region strongly connected, we follow these steps:
            </p>

            <ol class="project-ol">
              <li> Find the set of strongly connected components (SCCs) in the graph </li>
              <li> For each SCC:
                <ol class="project-ol">
                  <li>Find the SCC that is nearest to it</li>
                  <li>Find the smallest road connecting the two SCCs and make it bidirectional</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </li>

          <li class="project-phase">
            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 2: Divide the ward into blocks</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              A block is the smallest geographic area that is encompassed entirely by streets.
              Thus, the set of blocks can be found by computing the cycle basis of the ward graph
              without considering the direction of the streets. After this, we determine whether
              or not a cycle is strongly connected while considering the direction of the edges.
              If it is, we consider the cycle to be a block. Any edges that were not apart of a
              strongly connected cycle in the cycle basis will be considered blocks.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="project-phase">
            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 3: Chinese Postman Problem</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              If a robot visits a block, we will assume that the robot travels across every single
              road in the block at least once in order to find potholes that may not have been
              reported. We will also assume the robot starts and stops at the same spot in the
              block. This is known as the Chinese Postman Problem. The solution to this problem is
              to augment the graph of the ward to be Eulerian by adding edges to the graph of the
              ward. Typically, edges represent single roads, and thus it doesn't make sense to
              just fabricate new edges. However, edges can also represent a path of connected
              roads. Thus, we fabricate edges that are equally weighted to the minimum-weight path
              connecting the two vertices in the edge. The weight of an edge is considered to be
              its length in meters.
            </p>

          <li class="project-phase">
            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 4: Find the time it takes to travel the roads</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              Each robot can travel a certain maximum speed; however, the robot may not be able to
              travel that fast due to speed limits. To factor the speed limit, we go to each road
              in the graph of a ward, take the minimum of the speed limit and the speed of the
              robot, and then divide the length of the road by that speed. This will be the
              amount of time it takes for the robot to travel across the road. If the
              robots have different maximum speeds, then this calculation is performed
              for each unique maximum speed.

          <li class="project-phase">
            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 5: Map potholes to blocks</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              We obtain the set of potholes from the Chicago Data Portal using Pandas. Each
              pothole has a latitude and longitude in this dataset. We find the vertex that is
              nearest to this pothole using OSMNX and then find the block that the vertex is
              contained in. After this, we compute the number of pothole reports in each block and
              estimate the amount of time it would take to fill all potholes in the block at once.
              We assume the amount of time it takes to fill a single pothole is a constant (which
              we set to 15 minutes by default). We also consider the priority of filling potholes
              in the block to be the number of potholes assigned to that block.

            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 1: Rank blocks</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              Each block has a priority of being visited; however, we cannot simply visit the
              highest-priority blocks first. This is because high-priority blocks may be
              distant from the robot, which would end up wasting a lot of time if we visit
              them in that order. It's more efficient to visit some lower-priority blocks on
              the way to higher-priority blocks. Thus, we rank the blocks as a function of
              priority, the distance the center of the block is from the starting point of the
              robot, and the amount of time it would take to travel a block. The amount of
              time to travel a block is the sum of the time it takes to travel every road in
              the block and the time it takes to fill every pothole in the block.
            </p>

            <p class="project-p"> The rank is computed as follows: </p>

                \begin{cases}
                    \frac{priority}{\sqrt{TTT}} & dist \leq 500\text{m} \\
                    \frac{priority}{\sqrt{TTT*\frac{dist}{500}}} & dist > 500\text{m}\\

            <p class="project-p">
              Each block now has a rank. We want to maximize the total rank of blocks selected
              under the constraint the robot is not outside for too long. This optimization
              problem can be phrased in terms of a Binary Integer Program, which we
              implemented using ConvexPY (CVXPY).
            </p>

            <p class="project-p"> The optimization problem is as follows: </p>

            <ul class="project-ul-math">
              <li> \(X\) is a vector of bits that represents whether or not a block has been selected</li>
              <li> \(R\) is a vector of positive real numbers that represent the rank of a block</li>
              <li> \(TTT\) is a vector of positive real numbers that represent the amount of time it takes to travel across a block</li>
              <li> \(MaxTTT\) is the maximum amount of time the robot can be outside</li>

              $$ X*TTT^T \leq MaxTTT $$

          </li>

          <li class="project-phase">
            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 3: Order blocks</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              After we select the blocks, we must decide the order with which to visit the blocks.
              First, imagine that we fabricate roads between the blocks. The roads connect the
              center of each block to the centers of every other block. The length of this road is
              the Euclidean distance between the centers of the two blocks. We want to find the
              subset of these fabricated roads to travel across in order to visit every block at
              least once. This is equivalent to the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). To do this,
              we used a genetic algorithm from a TSP package in Python. Note, we do not actually
              fabricate those roads, we just compute the distance between the centers of two
              blocks whenever they get selected by the genetic algorithm. This prevents a
              substantial memory overhead.
            </p>
          </li>

          <li class="project-phase">
            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 4: Connect blocks</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              Now that we have the order with which to travel the blocks, we find the path
              that takes the least amount of time for the robot to travel (considering speed
              limits). Initially, the robot starts in a facility. Using OSMNX, we find the
              vertex that is nearest to the facility in the graph of the next block the robot
              will travel to. We then use Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm to find the
              minimum-weight path connecting the two vertices. We use travel time as the
              weight instead of distance. We do this for each block until the last block
              is connected to the block where the robot facility is located.

          <li class="project-phase">
            <h3 class="project-phase-h">Step 5: Remove blocks</h3>
            <p class="project-p">
              At this point, we have a route for a single robot to take. This route contains
              a set of blocks with potholes to fill. We do not want multiple robots visiting
              the same block, so we remove the set of blocks that this robot will visit from
              the pool of all blocks. This will guarantee that no two robots attempt to fill
              potholes in the same block.
